## Objective : Define basic AI terms (for example, AI, ML, deep learning, neural networks, computer vision, natural language processing [NLP], model, algorithm, training and inferencing, bias, fairness, fit, large language model [LLM]).

### ✅ **Core AI Terms Defined**

---

### 1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

AI is the field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and learning.

---

### 2. **Machine Learning (ML)**

ML is a subset of AI that involves teaching computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

---

### 3. **Deep Learning**

Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses **neural networks with many layers** to analyze large amounts of data. It is especially powerful for tasks like image recognition and language translation.

---

### 4. **Neural Networks**

A neural network is a computing system inspired by the human brain, made up of layers of interconnected nodes (or “neurons”) that process information in a way that allows the system to learn.

---

### 5. **Computer Vision**

Computer vision is a field of AI that trains computers to understand and interpret visual information from the world, such as images and videos.

---

### 6. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language, allowing for applications like chatbots, translation, and sentiment analysis.

---

### 7. **Model**

A model is the final product of a machine learning training process. It’s a mathematical function that maps input data to predicted output, based on learned patterns.

---

### 8. **Algorithm**

An algorithm is a set of rules or steps that a computer follows to perform a task — in ML, it refers to the method used to train a model (e.g., decision trees, gradient descent).

---

### 9. **Training**

Training is the process of teaching a machine learning model by feeding it data and adjusting its internal parameters so it can make accurate predictions or classifications.

---

### 10. **Inferencing**

Inferencing (or inference) is when a trained model is used to make predictions or decisions based on new, unseen data.

---

### 11. **Bias**

In AI, bias refers to systematic errors in a model caused by unfair assumptions in the training data or the way the model is built, which can lead to unfair outcomes.

---

### 12. **Fairness**

Fairness in AI means ensuring that models make unbiased decisions and treat all users equitably, avoiding discrimination based on race, gender, age, etc.

---

### 13. **Fit (Underfitting & Overfitting)**

* **Underfitting**: The model is too simple and cannot capture the patterns in the data.
* **Overfitting**: The model is too complex and memorizes the training data, performing poorly on new data.
* **Good fit**: The model generalizes well to new, unseen data.

---

### 14. **Large Language Model (LLM)**

An LLM is an AI model trained on a massive dataset of text. It can understand and generate human-like language, enabling tasks like answering questions, writing essays, or translating languages (e.g., ChatGPT).
